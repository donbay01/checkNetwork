However, while it is fun to browse and work on a free Wi-Fi connection, it is essential to note that this Wi-Fi network may not be secured or may be a fake Wi-Fi network.

An example is going to a restaurant, and after switching on your Wi-Fi, you find out there are other Wi-Fi connections with a similar name to the restaurant or hotel. These fake Wi-Fi are common in public places with lots of people or users who may be in urgent need of internet data to attend to work/pleasure activities. These public places include airports, Bus/Train stations, hotels, Restaurants, Airbnb apartments, fast food, coffee shops, etc.  Here are some guides to stay safe when on a public/free Wi-Fi connection.', textAlign: TextAlign.justify,),
